# Architectural Decision Records

This project will use *super lightweight* architectural decision records. I'm doing this to be nice to my future self and in case anyone finds this code and wonders "Why did he do it that way?" Note: It was probably because I didn't know any better... ;)

## ADRS

1. [Use a buffer and prioritize *recieving* data in it](1-buffer-prioritized-recieve.md)
